<p>This trio of posters were inspired by the individual heartbeat of each of the cities and what make them iconic throughout the world. The three elements used to create these ideals are patterning, architectural and typographic, for example the grid like pattern of New York City streets, the famous Eiffel Tower of Paris and the traditional black lettering of historic London. With their intricate detail and strong geometric structure these posters work well both up close and from afar.</p>
