<p>These two part invites were inspired by traditional wedding invites with the use of elegant hand lettering, copper block foil and a heavy beer mat stock they help in evoking a sense of occasion and excitement for the special day. Coupled with these elements the reverse also uses a condensed typeface and letterpress within a format that harps back to early event advertising which assists in setting the tone and style for the day ahead.</p>
