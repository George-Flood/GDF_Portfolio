<p>The Only God Forgives poster was designed in celebration of the film and visualises my interpretation on the morals of the story by focusing on the main character and his struggle between right, wrong and ultimately his forgiveness for past actions. To portray this the use of contrasting iconography, imagery and colour was used. The blue god like depiction of the main character to illustrate his desire for forgiveness and on the other hand the red stylised devil mask is used as an unwanted reminder of his past. Lastly overlaying these conflicting element in an anaglyph fashion help set the struggle and blur the lines between the two character traits.</p>
