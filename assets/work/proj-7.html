<p>This tender was to promote the Nuance company as the best retail solution for Helsinki airport, but in a highly competitive market our proposal had to stand out from the crowd to succeed. To accomplish this objective the use of infographics were introduced not only to highlight key and important information but to maintain and consolidate the heavy copy that is inevitable in a project of this size. Alongside this full page photography and striking brand colours help in creating an engaging and enjoyable experience which is important in this lengthy and complicated process.</p>
