<p>As Highbury college already possess a really strong and recognisable brand the aim for the Full-time prospectus was not to lose that focus but instead use existing elements and enhance them. This was achieved by utilising their strong colour palette to break down parts of the prospectus into easily digestible sections insuring the consumer would not become overwhelmed by the literature. Supporting this is the use of solid and striking graphics which maintained the viewer's engagement with every turn of the page.</p>
