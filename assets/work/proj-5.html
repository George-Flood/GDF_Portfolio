<p>The brief given was to create a shopping bag that reflected the luxury of the high end products sold in the Nuance Specialty stores such as Sunglasses watches and fashion, but at the same time not to step away from the main Duty Free Store brand. Using a spot UV varnish to highlight popular products sold in store along with a black stock gave the bag a premium look. Finally using the product words and isolating the N.U.A.N.C.E brand name in their primary colour helps the customer in making the connection between the two parts of the business.</p>
