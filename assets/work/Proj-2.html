<p>An A5 flyer solution to relaunch a local salon under new management. The given brief was to underline that the business was undertaking a fresh, young and contemporary development with an emphasis on the introduction of a barbers to the salon. This required both uniformed and individual branding and was accomplished by using a two colour scheme and reversing the primary and secondary colours for each of the businesses.
