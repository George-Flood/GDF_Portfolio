<p>Adibook is a luxury coffee table book archiving the history of Adidas Original trainers and their impact on popular culture. Using the iconic branding of Adidas and complementing it with strong typography and bold colour the book is a simple but engaging look at the individual trainers. The front cover is a heavy stock with blind letterpress reflecting the texture of the shoes themselves. Finishing off the publication is a promotional poster wrapping the book, printed on translucent stock the poster represents tissue paper protecting the book. Just like when buying a new pair of trainers. </p>
