<p>A fun and informal look at the traditional price list for a barber’s shop. The inspiration for the final piece was influenced by western americana typography with the use of spurred condensed fonts and victorian styled graphics with the inclusion of floral geometric patterning. Tied in with the existing brand colours and printed on heavily textured stock for a true hand crafted feel, the price list has an ornate wore-in look which sits well with the rest of the brand and shop furniture.</p>
